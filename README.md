# Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

 1. Software Engineering Definition and Importance
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It emphasizes structured processes, collaboration, and quality assurance to build reliable and scalable systems.  
Importance:  
- Ensures software is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs.  
- Reduces costs by preventing errors early in development.  
- Manages complexity in large-scale systems (e.g., banking software, healthcare systems).  
- Enforces standards for safety and security (e.g., aviation software).  

 2. Key Milestones in Software Engineering
1. 1968 NATO Conference: Coined the term "software engineering" to address the "software crisis" caused by unreliable and over-budget projects.  
2. 1970s Structured Programming: Introduced by Edsger Dijkstra, promoting modular, readable code to reduce complexity.  
3. 1980s Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Languages like C++ and Java enabled reusable, maintainable code through encapsulation and inheritance.  
4. 2001 Agile Manifesto: Prioritized iterative development and customer collaboration over rigid planning.  

 3. Phases of the SDLC
1. Requirements Gathering: Define user needs and system specifications.  
2. Design: Create system architecture (e.g., UML diagrams).  
3. Implementation: Write code following design specifications.  
4. Testing: Validate functionality (unit, integration, system tests).  
5. Deployment: Release to production (e.g., cloud hosting).  
6. Maintenance: Fix bugs, update features, and optimize performance.  

 4. Waterfall vs. Agile
| Waterfall | Agile |  
|---------------|-----------|  
| Sequential phases (no backtracking). | Iterative cycles (sprints). |  
| Rigid scope; changes are costly. | Flexible; welcomes changing requirements. |  
| Example Use Case: Regulatory compliance software (fixed requirements). | Example Use Case: Startup MVP with evolving features. |  

 5. Roles in a Software Team
- Software Developer: Writes code, debugs, and collaborates on design.  
- QA Engineer: Designs test cases, automates testing, and reports bugs.  
- Project Manager: Manages timelines, resources, and stakeholder communication.  

 6. IDEs and VCS
- IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm): Provide syntax highlighting, debugging, and build tools.  
- VCS (e.g., Git, GitHub): Track changes, enable collaboration, and manage code versions.  

 7. Common Challenges & Solutions
- Changing Requirements: Use Agile sprints for flexibility.  
- Integration Issues: Adopt CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins).  
- Time Management: Break tasks into smaller milestones using tools like Jira.  

 8. Testing Types
- Unit Testing: Tests individual functions (e.g., JUnit for Java).  
- Integration Testing: Checks module interactions (e.g., API endpoints).  
- System Testing: Validates end-to-end workflows (e.g., user login flow).  
- Acceptance Testing: Ensures alignment with user needs (e.g., UAT with stakeholders).

# Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

 1. Prompt Engineering
Prompt Engineering involves crafting precise instructions to guide AI models (e.g., ChatGPT) to generate accurate and relevant outputs.  
Importance:  
- Reduces ambiguity in AI responses.  
- Enhances efficiency (e.g., "Summarize this text in bullet points" vs. "Write about this text").  

 2. Prompt Example
- Vague Prompt: "Write about climate change."  
  Issues: Too broad, no focus.  
- Improved Prompt: "Explain three economic impacts of climate change on coastal cities, using 2020 data, in 200 words."  
  Why Effective: Specific topic, scope (economic impacts), data constraints, and concise length.
